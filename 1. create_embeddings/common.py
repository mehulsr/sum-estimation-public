"""Shared plumbing for the per-combination embedding generation scripts.

Every `generate_<dataset>_<encoder>.py` script in this directory owns exactly one
(dataset, encoder) combination: it knows how to stream that dataset's items and
how to encode them. Everything that is identical across combinations lives here:

* `StreamingEncoderSource` - batching / truncation loop around a stream of items
* `write_embeddings`       - memory-mapped `.npy` writing (raw and/or normalised)
* `build_parser` / `Combination` - the CLI shared by every script

Adding a new combination therefore means one new script that subclasses
`StreamingEncoderSource` and declares a `Combination`; nothing here changes.

Output is sharded by default (`--chunk-rows`, DEFAULT_CHUNK_ROWS rows each) so a
failed run can resume, i.e. for prefix `<dataset>_<encoder>`:

    <prefix>_00000_embeddings.npy       (raw vectors; _normalised.npy per --write)
    <prefix>_00000_ids.txt              (asset id per row, line N <-> row N)
    <prefix>_manifest.json              (shard list, row counts, resume point)

`--chunk-rows 0` writes one unnumbered matrix per variant instead
(`<prefix>_embeddings.npy`, `<prefix>_ids.txt`), which is what
`2. create_hnsw_index/qdrant_insert.py` also reads (it prefers the sharded
layout when a manifest is present).
